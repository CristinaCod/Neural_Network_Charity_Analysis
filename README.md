# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose


## Results
**Data Preprocessing**
o	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

o	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

o	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 


**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
o	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

o	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

o	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

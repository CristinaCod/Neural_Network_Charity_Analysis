# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose


## Results
**Data Preprocessing**

o	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

o	What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

o	What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 


**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**

o	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

o	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

o	What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? 



## Summary
### Findings
The goal of the deep learning neural network model was to reach 75% predictive accuracy or higher which theoretically seems highly attainable. In the original model we only achieved 73% accuracy. After attempting to the optimize the model through multiple means we still did not reach that 75% threshold. Attempt one involved adding more neurons to the hidden layers which still only yielded a 73% accuracy. Attempt two of adding another hidden layer yielded 72% accuracy. Attempt three of using a different activation function on the hidden layers yielded 72% accuracy as well. So clearly none of these attempts had any significant difference on the predictive accuracy.
